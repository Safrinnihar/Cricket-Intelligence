# Cricket-Intelligence
Analyzed 13 years of IPL (Indian Premier League) data from 2008 to 2020, leveraging SQL to extract key insights through 20+ complex queries, showcasing expertise in data analysis and sports analytics. The project demonstrates an ability to handle large datasets, structure analytical queries, and uncover actionable insights.

# Datasets
This project uses two IPL datasets covering seasons from 2008 to 2020:
